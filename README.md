This provides a valuable information about numpy and usage of numpy in data science..

NumPy is a foundational library in Python for data science and numerical computing. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. Here's how NumPy is commonly used in data science:

It includes:

1.Importing numpy library.

2.Creating 1d array,nd array through various inbuilt functions.

3.Array properties.

4.Data Manipulation includes:indexing, slicing, reshaping, and applying mathematical operations.

5.Data Aggregation includes:statistics like mean, median, standard deviation, and sum.

6.Data Analysis includes:data analysis using Numpy to find correlations, identify outliers, and
calculate percentiles, NumPyâ€™s efficiency in handling large datasets.

7.Numpy usage.

8.Numpy application in data science.

9.Summary..
